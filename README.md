- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rastapopoulo
- 👀 I’m interested in coding for not too long.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python through training on Udemy. I am student in France in atmospheric sciences.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects to improve my programming knowledge. I am a beginner in this field and I do this for fun so I don't think I can carry a project alone.
- 📫 How to reach me: raphael.ollier3@gmail.com, I check regularly.
